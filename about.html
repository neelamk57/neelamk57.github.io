            “Curiosity is the essence of human existence. 'Who are we? Where are we? Where do we come from? 
            Where are we going?' I don't know. I don't have any answers to those questions. I don't know what's
            over there around the corner. But I want to find out.”

            My journey from aspiring to become a doctor to discovering my true calling in computer science has
            been shaped by this exact curiosity. During high school, my fascination with technology and 
            problem-solving led me to pursue Electronics, Communication, and Information Engineering at 
            Thapathali Campus, Nepal—where I realized my passion for using code to unravel complex challenges.

            <h2><strong>Undergraduate Breakthrough</strong></h2>
            <p>
              In 2023, I completed my degree with a thesis on a <strong>Transformer-Based Deep Coding Engine 
              for High-Level Source Code Generation</strong>. The project was selected as one of the best 
              final-year projects on campus, and I had the honor of presenting it at the first-ever 
              Thapathali Graduate Conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              More importantly, I was entrusted to deliver a <strong>presenter's note on behalf of all 
              graduating students</strong>—a moment that taught me how technical work gains meaning when 
              communicated with clarity and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nepal, my home country, is making strides in software engineering and AI—but much of this 
              progress focuses on product development rather than research. My goal is to change that by 
              leveraging our untapped data to model real-world problems.
